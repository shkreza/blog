I want to start this first blog with the topic that is closest to my heart -
*building things*. It's both the joy and desire to create something new, and
perhaps a life-defining purpose that drives us humans to build, and to create.
It's what has advanced our civilization over the years. It's what makes us
special.

As an engineer, I see builders everywhere - construction workers (obviously!),
technologists, artists and scientists (building a new gadget, an artwork or an
understanding of our world), and even peers and friends (building a lasting
relationship).

So this blog is devoted to building things that I value most -- given my
background, I think future posts will likely be skewed to technology. After
all, that is also what I love most ;)
