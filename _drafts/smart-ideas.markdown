# Find-my-owner button
Apple has long had a find-my-device feature -- quite helpful, if you forgot
where you placed your phone. Inherently, find-my-device is an owner-initiated
action, i.e., the owner says "Oops! where is my phone?"

There are cases, however were you may find someone else's device, wondering who
owns it or how to get it to the owner. This is a find-my-owner scenario. I
wonder why not add a button on the phone's home screen that you can push to
return a lost phone to its owner.
